# League of Legends Random Button

Since the League of Legends random button is not available anymore, I've written a software to replace it.

To install this software, you need to download and install [Go](https://golang.org/).

Then you can open a terminal and type `go get github.com/miltfra/lol-random-button`. Then you can execute the file at `$GOPATH/bin/lol-random-button`.

Alternatively you can have a look at the [release page](https://github.com/MiltFra/lol-random-button/releases) and download the latest release for your platform.

## TODO

- [ ] Off-Meta button
- [ ] champion names with spaces
- [ ] custom lists
