# League of Legends Random Button

Since the League of Legends random button is not available anymore, I've written a software to replace it.

## Installation

### Compiling from source (recommended)

To install this software, you need to download and install [Go](https://golang.org/) as well as [Fyne](https://fyne.io). To compile you need certain [prerequisites](https://fyne.io/develop/compiling.html).

Then you can open a terminal and type `go get github.com/miltfra/lol-random-button`. Then you can execute the file at `$GOPATH/bin/lol-random-button`.

### Downloading a pre-compiled executable (simple)

Alternatively you can have a look at the [release page](https://github.com/MiltFra/lol-random-button/releases) and download the latest release for your platform.
